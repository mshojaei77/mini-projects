# Mini Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I store all of my practice short codes as I continue to develop my coding skills. You'll find a variety of code snippets here covering different programming languages and concepts, including Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more.

These snippets are designed to demonstrate my understanding of various coding concepts and showcase my problem-solving abilities. Feel free to take a look around and explore the code. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks for visiting!
